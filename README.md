Appendix 1. NEX file used for phylogenetic inference of the “all-sequences” dataset under a MCMC Bayesian framework in MrBayes v3.2.6, and jModelTest v2.1.10 results used to select the best-fit nucleotide substitution model.

Appendix 2. XML file used for divergence time estimation under the nested dating approach using the “outgroup” and “population-only” datasets in BEAST v1.8.2.

Appendix 3. Rev code used for estimating ancestral ranges and dispersal and extinction rates using the DEC model in RevBayes v1.0.11.

Appendix 4. XML file used for estimating ancestral ranges and migration events using the DTA approach in BEAST v1.8.2.

Appendix 5. XML file used for estimating ancestral ranges and migration events using the BASTA approach in BEAST v2.4.7.
